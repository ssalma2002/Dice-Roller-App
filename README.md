## 📱 About the Project

Flutter Dice Roller is a simple yet elegant dice rolling application built with Flutter. This app demonstrates fundamental Flutter concepts through a practical and interactive project. It generates random dice rolls, featuring a visually appealing interface with gradient backgrounds and smooth user interactions.

This project was designed as a learning experience to solidify foundational Flutter skills in state management, widget composition, and asset handling.

## 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

- **Widget Composition:** Building user interfaces by combining basic Flutter widgets.
- **State Management:** Using `StatefulWidget` and `setState()` for dynamic UI updates.
- **Project Organization:** Structuring code across multiple files for maintainability.
- **Asset Management:** Properly including and referencing images and assets in Flutter projects.
- **User Interaction:** Handling button presses and responding to user input.
- **Layout Design:** Using `Column`, `Center`, and `SizedBox` widgets for layout.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Project Structure

lib/
├── main.dart # App entry point
├── gradient_container.dart # Custom gradient background widget
└── dice_roller.dart # Dice rolling logic and UI components


### Key Features

- **Custom Gradient Container:** A reusable widget with configurable colors, implemented using constructor functions and widget parameters.
- **State Management:** Uses Dart's `Random()` for generating dice rolls and `setState()` to update the UI dynamically.
- **Dynamic Asset Loading:** Dice images change based on the current dice value using string interpolation, with proper asset configuration in `pubspec.yaml`.
